```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gunter-trooper/ML-Group-Work/master/Machine-learning-databases/winequality-red.csv"

winequality_red <- read_delim(url,";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown



```{r wine}
winequality_red %>% head()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
