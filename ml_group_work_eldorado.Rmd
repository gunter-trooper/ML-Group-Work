## R Markdown



```{r wine1}
winequality_red %>% summary()
fit <- lm(quality ~ .,data = winequality_red)
summary(fit)
hist(winequality_red$quality)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r wine2}
library(splines)
lm.regressionSplines <- lm(quality ~ bs(alcohol, df = 3), data = winequality_red)
summary(lm.regressionSplines)
plot(lm.regressionSplines)
```



```{r wine3}
library(mgcv)
gam.1 <- gam(quality ~ s(alcohol) + s(sulphates) + s(pH), data = winequality_red)
summary(gam.1)
plot(gam.1, residuals = TRUE, cex = 2)
```




```{r wine4}
library(ISLR)
library(tree)

wine_tree <-  tree(quality ~ . ,data = winequality_red)

plot(wine_tree)
text(wine_tree, cex=0.75) # cex: set character size to 0.75

summary(wine_tree)
```
